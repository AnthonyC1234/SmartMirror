# Smart Mirror
At Blue Stamp I am creating a smart mirror using magic mirror. My goal is to have multiple modules all functioning on this smart mirror.

# Second Milestone


For my second milestone I added a few new modules I added a smart phone control module that would allow my to control my mirror modules and settings from my phone. I have also added a voice assistant that I named Jarvis. This voice assistant would be able to activate and deactivate modules depending on what I would like to see. Since my first milestone Ive also included the touch screen overlay to inable the touch screen module.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi. I had to install the magic mirror on Raspian, which gave me access to the default layout of the magic mirror. From there, I removed the compliments module and basic weather module. I replaced the original weather with a 3-day weather module. I also added a touch screen module and a wallpaper rotation from fire tv screen savers.
